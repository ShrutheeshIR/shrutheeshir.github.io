Project Jatayu is the autonomous UAV team of RVCE (undergrad university)
- Built multiple UAVs, both multicoptors and fixed wings.
- Developed robust perception modules for noisy and poorly lit video footage from drones for object detection and localization. Some of the work available [here](https://github.com/ShrutheeshIR/ODLC-GUI)
- As the team lead, participated in the Student Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Challenge (SUAS 2019), held in Maryland, USA. [Details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rCvikNtklg) about the drone developed for the competition.
