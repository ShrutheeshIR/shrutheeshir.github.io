Development of teleoperation of a robot humanoid nurse towards ANA Xprize Avatar challenge

- Advised by Prof. Bharadwaj Amrutur and Prof. Raghu Krishnapuram
- Research project to develop a teleoperated humanoiod robotic nurse as part of ANA Xprize Avatar challenge which aims to deploy real-time senses in remote environments.
- Research project in collaboration with ARTPARK, Tata Consultancy Services and Hanson Robotics.
- Worked on tracking human arm movements on the robot using optical trackers and VR technology, and relaying the operations.
- Developed an in-house data glove with finger tracking and haptic feedback for hand teleoperation.
- Contributed to the entire teleoperation architecture including networking and inverse kinematics \& control
- Team went on to reach the semi-finals of the competition.
