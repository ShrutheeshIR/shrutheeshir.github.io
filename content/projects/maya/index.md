In a team of 3, developed an end-to-end VR application for 3D reconstruction and VR rendering of archaeological sites with an inertial RGBD camera using SLAM. Code available at [github](https://github.com/KolinGuo/maya-slam)
- Primarily contributed to the development and interface of SLAM to obtain 6D pose trajectory
- Implemented using C++, Python, ROS, Unity and Docker, as part of Embedded Systems course CSE237D
