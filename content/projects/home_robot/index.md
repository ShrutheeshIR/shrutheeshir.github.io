Research Project with Jiaming Hu, [Anwesan Pal](https://anwesanpal.github.io/), Jiaming Hu, Akanimoh Adeyele,  Aditya Aggarwal and Prof. Henrik Christensen at Cogrob UCSD. 
- Developing an assistant robot that can help humans in everyday house-hold cleanup tasks.
- Worked on task planning and system architecture with integration, to orchestrate the behavior of the robot. 
- Presented at the [IEEE Robotic Computing Conference 2023](https://www.ieee-irc.org/). [Paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06129.pdf).
