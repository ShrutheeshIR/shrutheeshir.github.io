Research Project in developing a generalized framework for robot tool improvization using affordances. Complex reasoning allows robots to "think outside the box" using available items to improvize in unforseen environments.
- Advised by [Prof. Henrik Christensen](https://hichristensen.com)
- Working on recognizing and using affordances of objects and tools.
- Implementing an end-to-end working pipeline on V-Rep CoppeliaSim Simulation Environment, and on a real Fetch robot.
