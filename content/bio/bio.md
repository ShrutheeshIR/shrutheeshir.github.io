I'm an aspiring roboticist interested in building intelligent systems capable of reasoning and action. I'm interested in problems ranging from active perception to planning for robotics. 
Currently, I am a perception software engineer at [Aurora Innovation](https://aurora.tech/), building perception systems for self-driving trucks, since July 2023.

I graduated from UC San Diego with a masters in Computer Science, specializing in robotics, where I worked on problems related to task planning for robot manipulation and service robotics under Prof. [Henrik Christensen](https://http://www.hichristensen.com/).

Before I joined UCSD, I completed my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [RV College of Engineering (RVCE)](http://rvce.edu.in/), India.

For my undergraduate thesis, I worked as an intern at the [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Science (RBCCPS, IISc) under Prof. Raghu Krishnapuram and Prof. Bharadwaj Amrutur, and later continued as a technical associate at RBCCPS. During my time at RBCCPS, I worked on autonomous navigation and robot teleoperation.

During my time at RVCE, I was a member of Project Jatayu, the autonomous UAV team of RVCE, where I also served as the team lead for the SUAS 2019 competition. I primarily worked on the Computer Vision and Communication subsystem, providing perception capabilities to our drone. Here, we represented India among a few other teams in an [international UAV competition](https://suas-competition.org/) held in Maryland, USA. This is when I developed an interest in robotics and autonomous navigation in specific, and have been working in this domain since.
