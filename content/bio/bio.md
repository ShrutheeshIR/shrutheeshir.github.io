I'm an aspiring roboticist at UCSD, interested in problems ranging from autonomous navigation to robot manipulation. During the summer of 2022, I worked as a perception intern at [Aurora Innovation](https://aurora.tech/), where I developed libraries for 3D object detection.

Before I joined UCSD, I completed my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [RV College of Engineering (RVCE)](http://rvce.edu.in/), India.

For my undergraduate thesis, I worked as an intern at the [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Science (RBCCPS, IISc) under Prof. Raghu Krishnapuram and Prof. Bharadwaj Amrutur, and later continued as a technical associate at RBCCPS. During my time at RBCCPS, I worked on autonomous navigation and robot teleoperation.

During my time at RVCE, I was a member of Project Jatayu, the autonomous UAV team of RVCE, where I also served as the team lead for the SUAS 2019 competition. I primarily worked on the Computer Vision and Communication subsystem, providing perception capabilities to our drone, and transmitting it robustly. Here, we represented India among a few other teams in an international UAV competition held in Maryland, USA. This is when I developed an interest in robotics and autonomous navigation in specific, and have been working in this domain since.
