 Hello there ðŸ‘‹.

I'm a robotics software engineer at [Aurora Innovation](https://aurora.tech), developing self-driving tech.

I'm interested in developing robot systems, to be deployed onto the noisy real world, tackling problems ranging from robot manipulation to navigation. 

I graduated from UC San Diego with a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in robotics. Here, I conducted my research at the [Cognitive Robotics Lab](https://cogrob.org) at the Contextual Robotics Institute, UCSD, where I worked on developing an improvisational framework for robot tool use through affordances. Thesis available [here](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8622p2rs).

And when I'm not doing robotics, you'd typically find me watching cricket or football (re: soccer) or passionately defending why the Eagles could not have carried the ring to Mordor.
