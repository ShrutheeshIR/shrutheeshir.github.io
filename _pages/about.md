Hello there &#128075;.

I'm a first year graduate student pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in robotics.

I'm interested in developing robot systems and simulations, tackling problems ranging from manipulation to navigation and SLAM.

And when I'm not doing robotics, you'd typically find me watching cricket or football (re: soccer) or passionately defending why the Eagles could not have carried the ring to Mordor.
