I":<p>Hello there ðŸ‘‹.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a first year graduate student pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in robotics.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in developing robot systems, to be deployed onto the messy real world, tackling problems ranging from robot manipulation to navigation and SLAM.</p>

<p>And when Iâ€™m not doing robotics, youâ€™d typically find me watching cricket or football (re: soccer) or passionately defending why the Eagles could not have carried the ring to Mordor.</p>
